# JS Advanced Sept 2023 - Learning and Collaboration Repository

Welcome to the JS Advanced Sept 2023 Course Repository! This repository is aimed at providing a platform for beginners in programming to learn, collaborate, and improve their coding skills. It was created in response to the growing interest among individuals who want to not only write their own code but also understand and enhance code written by others.

## How It Works

* **GitHub Fundamentals**: Before contributing, make sure to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of using GitHub. If you're new to GitHub, there are many resources available online to help you get started.

* **Fork the Course Repository**: After gaining access, fork this repository to create a copy under your GitHub account.

* **Create a Branch**: Create a branch for the solution you want to share. This branch will contain your code changes.

* **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Submit a pull request to the main branch with your solution. This is where your code changes will be reviewed by fellow participants and instructors.

* **Review and Collaborate**: While waiting for feedback on your PR, review the code submitted by others and provide constructive comments and suggestions for improvement.

* **Merge Your Code**: If your solution is deemed good to go, it will be approved and merged into the main branch, contributing to the collective knowledge base.

* **Continuous Learning**: Keep learning and improving your coding skills by actively participating in discussions and code reviews. Remember that the focus here is on quality rather than quantity.

## Important Rules
* **This activity is not affiliated with grading**: Please note that your participation here will not affect your grades or course progress. It is purely for your personal learning and skill enhancement.

* **No Strict Ties to the Judge Systems**: Solutions shared here are not meant to be directly tied to grading for the Softuni Judge system. The purpose is to collaborate and improve code, so don't overly focus on whether a solution passes a specific test or not.

* **Responsible Pull Requests**: When opening a pull request, make an effort to respond promptly to comments, make necessary improvements, and aim to merge within 1-2 days. Long-standing pull requests may be closed to keep the repository organized.

* **Quality Over Quantity**: We value the quality of contributions over the quantity of pull requests. Share solutions that you genuinely want to improve, rather than simply aiming to increase your PR count.
